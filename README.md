# OffsetMethane
This is the code and the supplementary material complementing the article "Temporary carbon removals to offset methane emissions."
The Matlab file "Table_SVO_Methane.mat" makes Table 1.
The Matlab file "IRFproject.mat" makes the graphs of the paper, including extra graphs which are also in pdf in this depository. 
The excel files "IRF_CO2" and "IRF_Methane" are the temperature impact response functions digitized from Azar et al. 2023.
The excel file "Value of an offset with variable carbon storage" allows you to calculate to introduce the tonnes of carbon stored in each year on sheet 2 column M to obtain the value of an impermanent carbon removal in cell N4. Lenght of the project can also be set on sheet 1 B3 and failure rate on sheet 1 B5.
